# to do:
    # find better pics for dresi and kebaby
    # find out how to make buttons
    # find out how to make timed choice menus
    # adjust positioning
    # try to find out how to fix the jump issue
    # find some chill track to play in the bg
    # set up kanikuły
    # animate a shitty pic of Kacper
    # what should all świeżaki do? make a special cg show up?
    
# so... in the end we've got one true good ending? i believe
