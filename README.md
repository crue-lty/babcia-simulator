my visual novel for 2018 nanoreno!!

this is my first game project all in all and surprisingly it started out as a very ironic idea but then i started putting effort in it.
now im really trying to make it be good, lmao.

im pretty sure illl finish it before nanoreno ends, im almost done with writing the script.
ill be releasing a beta version soonish for testing.

if theres anything wrong in the code or you want to comment, hmu at baudelairequotingbitch @ tumblr.
